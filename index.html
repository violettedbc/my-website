		<h2>Why traveling?</h2>
		<p>I really like traveling. Each year, I try to move the most. Traveling has a lot of benefits. It enables you to see how much the city you live in is little, no matter how important it is. It's always a good experience to trvael, even if come from a wealthy place and you go to a poor place. It enables to see new landscapes, other cultures, discover other languages and so on. It allows you to think differently and to better the world on a global scale.</p>

		<h2>How I like to travel</h2>
		<p>So far, I mostly travelled with my family, and it has always been a good experience. A few times, I had the opportunity to leave France with some friends and it was even better. Taking the control over the preparations such as the booking of the rooms but also the preparation of the visits took time but it was really interesting to do so. I would in the future to be able to be more carefull on my ecological footprint.</p>

	<div id="tips" class="card">
		<h2>My tips</h2>
		<p>I can give you a few advices based on my short personal experience. Of course, first of all, prepare your travel the better you can. You'll always have unexpected things to manage during your trip, and so preparing your trip will make it easier to manage. Book your flight or your way of transport, and your hostel way before you go. In that way, you'll have lower prices. I encourage you to try the youth hostel if you're still young. You probably won't have the same comfort but it worth the try, and it's generally cheaper.</p>
